# ecommerce

Since this is a full E-Commerce Product Page using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, SQL Server, and Blazor, Here is a clean and modular structure for my project, covering:

✅ Backend: ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework (EF Core) for database interaction
✅ Frontend: Razor Pages/Blazor for UI
✅ Database: SQL Server for storing products, users, and orders
✅ Features: Product catalog, shopping cart, user authentication, and payment integration
